## Better Auth guide

Better Auth's [basic usage guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/basic-usage)
applies to Convex as well. It covers signing in and out, social providers,
plugins, and more. You will be using Better Auth directly in your
project, so their guides are a primary reference.

### Exceptions

There are a few areas in the Better Auth basic usage guide that work differently
in Convex.

- #### Server side authentication

  Better Auth supports signing users in and out through server side functions. Because
  Convex functions run over websockets and don't return HTTP responses or set
  cookies, signing up/in/out must be done from the client via
  `authClient.signIn.*` methods.

- #### Schemas and migrations

  The basic usage guide includes information on database schema generation and
  migrations via the Better Auth CLI. This only applies for [local
  installs](/local-install), which support generating schemas. For projects not
  using local install, the default schema provided with the Better Auth
  component (preconfigured with the [supported
  plugins](/supported-plugins)) is used, and cannot be altered.

## Using server methods with `auth.api`

Better Auth's server side `auth.api` methods can be used with your `createAuth`
function and the component `headers` method. Here's an example implementing the [`changePassword` server
method](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/users-accounts#api-method-change-password).

```ts
export const updateUserPassword = mutation({
  args: {
    currentPassword: v.string(),
    newPassword: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Many Better Auth server methods require a currently authenticated
    // user, so request headers have to be passed in so session cookies
    // can be parsed and validated. The `headers` utility can be used here.
    await createAuth(ctx).api.changePassword({
      body: {
        currentPassword: args.currentPassword,
        newPassword: args.newPassword,
      },
      headers: await authComponent.getHeaders(ctx),
    });
  },
});
```

## Using Convex ctx in Better Auth config

The `ctx` param passed in to the `createAuth` function is the Convex context
object. This can be used to access the Convex database or Convex functions in
your Better Auth config. It can be a [query](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/query-functions#query-context),
[mutation](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/mutation-functions#mutation-context),
or [action](https://docs.convex.dev/functions/actions#action-context) context.

A common use case is sending emails for verification or password resets with
the [Resend component](https://www.convex.dev/components/resend).
`resend.sendEmail` will produce a type error because the ctx object could be a
query ctx. The component provides type guards for this.

```ts
import { requireActionCtx } from "@convex-dev/better-auth/utils";
import { Resend } from "@convex-dev/resend";
import { components } from "./_generated/api";
import { type ActionCtx } from "./_generated/server";

export const resend = new Resend(components.resend);

export const createAuth = (
  ctx: ActionCtx,
  { optionsOnly } = { optionsOnly: false }
) =>
  betterAuth({
    baseURL: siteUrl,
    sendVerificationEmail: async ({ user, url }) => {
      // This function only requires a `runMutation` property on the ctx object,
      // but we'll make sure we have an action ctx because we know a network
      // request is being made, which requires an action ctx.
      await resend.sendEmail(requireActionCtx(ctx), {
        to: user.email,
        subject: "Verify your email",
        html: `<p>Click <a href="${url}">here</a> to verify your email</p>`,
      });
    },
  });
```
