## Better Auth guide

Better Auth's [basic usage guide](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/basic-usage)
applies to Convex as well. It covers signing in and out, social providers,
plugins, and more. You will be using Better Auth directly in your
project, so their guides are a primary reference.

### Exceptions

There are a few areas in the Better Auth basic usage guide that work differently
in Convex.

- #### Server-side authentication

  Better Auth supports signing users in and out through server-side functions. Because
  Convex functions run over websockets and don't return HTTP responses or set
  cookies, signing up/in/out must be done from the client via
  `authClient.signIn.*` methods.

- #### Schemas and migrations

  The basic usage guide includes information on database schema generation and
  migrations via the Better Auth CLI. This only applies for [local
  installs](/local-install), which support generating schemas. For projects not
  using local install, the default schema provided with the Better Auth
  component (preconfigured with the [supported
  plugins](/supported-plugins)) is used and cannot be altered.

## Using server methods with `auth.api`

Better Auth's server-side `auth.api` methods can be used with your `createAuth`
function and the component `headers` method. Here's an example implementing the [`changePassword` server
method](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/concepts/users-accounts#api-method-change-password).

```ts
export const updateUserPassword = mutation({
  args: {
    currentPassword: v.string(),
    newPassword: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Many Better Auth server methods require a currently authenticated
    // user, so request headers have to be passed in so session cookies
    // can be parsed and validated. The `headers` utility can be used here.
    await createAuth(ctx).api.changePassword({
      body: {
        currentPassword: args.currentPassword,
        newPassword: args.newPassword,
      },
      headers: await authComponent.getHeaders(ctx),
    });
  },
});
```
