title: Triggers
description: Run transactional callbacks when auth data changes
---

Triggers are a Convex-first approach to running mutations when your Better Auth
data changes. Better Auth already supports this behavior for some tables through
`databaseHooks` configuration, but database hooks cannot currently run in the
same transaction as the original operation.

Triggers run in the same transaction as the original operation, and work on any
table in your Better Auth schema.

## Configuration

To enable triggers, pass the `triggers` option to the component client config. A
trigger config object has table names as keys, and each table name can be
assigned an object with any of `onCreate`, `onUpdate`, or `onDelete` hooks.
Throwing an error in a trigger will stop the original operation from committing.

<Callout>
  A single Better Auth endpoint or `auth.api` call can perform multiple database
  interactions. Throwing an error in a trigger will only ensure the database
  operation that triggered will fail, but any previous operations will still
  commit.

```ts title="convex/auth.ts"
import { createClient } from "@convex-dev/better-auth";
import { components, internal } from "./_generated/api";
import { AuthFunctions } from "@convex-dev/better-auth";
import { DataModel } from "./_generated/dataModel";

const authFunctions: AuthFunctions = internal.auth;

export const authComponent = createClient<DataModel>(components.betterAuth, {
  authFunctions,
  triggers: {
    user: {
      onCreate: async (ctx, doc) => {
        await ctx.db.insert("posts", {
          title: "Hello, world!",
          userId: doc._id,
        });
      },
      onUpdate: async (ctx, newDoc, oldDoc) => {
        // Both old and new documents are available so you can compare and detect
        // changes - you can ignore oldDoc if you don't need it.
      },
      onDelete: async (ctx, doc) => {
        // The entire deleted document is available
      },
    },
  },
});

export const { onCreate, onUpdate, onDelete } = authComponent.triggersApi();
```
