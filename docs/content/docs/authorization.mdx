### Showing UI based on authentication state

You can control which UI is shown when the user is signed in or signed out using
Convex's `<Authenticated>`, `<Unauthenticated>`, and `<AuthLoading>` helper
components. These components are powered by Convex's `useConvexAuth()` hook,
which provides `isAuthenticated` and `isLoading` flags. This hook can be used
directly if preferred.

It's important to use Convex's authentication state components or the
`useConvexAuth()` hook instead of Better Auth's `getSession()` or `useSession()`
when you need to check whether the user is logged in or not. Better Auth will
reflect an authenticated user before Convex does, as the Convex client must
subsequently validate the token provided by Better Auth. Convex functions that
require authentication can throw if called before Convex has validated the token.

In the following example, the `<Content />` component is a child of
`<Authenticated>`, so its content and any of its child components are guaranteed
to have an authenticated user, and Convex queries can require authentication.

```tsx title="src/App.tsx"
import {
  Authenticated,
  Unauthenticated,
  AuthLoading,
  useQuery,
} from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Unauthenticated>Logged out</Unauthenticated>
      <Authenticated>Logged in</Authenticated>
      <AuthLoading>Loading...</AuthLoading>
    </main>
  );
}

const Content = () => {
  const messages = useQuery(api.messages.getForCurrentUser);
  return <div>Authenticated content: {messages?.length}</div>;
};

export default App;
```

### Authentication state in Convex functions

If the client is authenticated, you can access the information stored in the JWT
via `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity`.

If the client is **not** authenticated, `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity` will return null.

Make sure that the component calling this query is a child of `<Authenticated>`
from `convex/react`, or that `isAuthenticated` from `useConvexAuth()` is `true`.
Otherwise, it will throw on page load.

```ts title="convex/messages.ts"
import { query } from "./_generated/server";

// You can get the current user from the auth component
export const getCurrentUser = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    return await authComponent.getAuthUser(ctx);
  },
});

// You can also just get the authenticated user ID as you
// normally would from ctx.auth.getUserIdentity
export const getForCurrentUser = query({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    const identity = await ctx.auth.getUserIdentity();
    if (identity === null) {
      throw new Error("Not authenticated");
    }
    return await ctx.db
      .query("messages")
      .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("author"), identity.email))
      .collect();
  },
});
```
